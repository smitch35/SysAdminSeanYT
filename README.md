# SysAdminSean 
This github project will be host to most of the config files and what not used during the youtube videos.  They will be scrubbed of any secure info and variables will be added, so that you know what you need to change.

# YouTube
In case you've found this first you can head over to https://youtube.com/SysAdminSean to check out the videos related to this repo!

# Blogger
If you would prefer to read long and follow the blog https://sysadminsean.blogspot.com/ will have posts for every video and links back here for config files used for the day if any for each video post.

# Support
Support comes in many different fashsions.  Watch the vidoes, comment on the vidoes (I'm not the final source on any of the infomration I give, just a point of reference from someone that works in the field), request more infomation on the code via the issues system and I'll do my best to help or subscribe on my patreon.  The link for that can be found on the youtube videos.
