## VS Code
VS Code is a really cool product for writing code and maintaining repos.

## ChatGPT
ChatGPT is an amazing starting tool.  You can use it in a multitude of different ways from helping design script outlines to writing basic video descriptions or even code snippets.  If you are going to use a tool like this you have to be very careful when what you're doing with it.  Don't give away company secrets on purpose or accident and don't completely trust what it gets you.  If you can't read the code it spits out, learn how to read what it's supposed to be doing and verify that code exists.

There is a reason to have a TEST Enviornment!

## GIT
GIT is amzing for code version management.  If you write anything from simple batch scripts to full on applications you should be using this to help manage all your history and changes.  Anything else is really just poor judgement.

## GITLAB/ GITHUB
These two web options give a nice GUI to the GIT environment.  Using these tools you can collaborate more visually with other members and work on some really fantastic projects, like this one!

## SysInternals
This is a really broad set of tools that can be used for Linux or Windows (i'd wager mostly windows) that really just expand on what is available via the system.  Yes Powershell can probably do the same things and better but until you get you feet in the deep end of the powershell pool well you have to start somewhere.
